A is a nonresident alien who is a resident of Country A, and B is a U.S. citizen. In 2018, Partnership earned $200 of U.S. source royalty income. Partnership was required to withhold 30 percent of the gross amount of the royalty income allocable to A unless Partnership had documentation that it could rely on to establish that A was entitled to a reduced rate of withholding. See \u00a7\u00a7\u20091.1441-1(b)(1) and 1.1441-5(b)(2)(i)(A) of this chapter. Partnership withheld $15 from the $100 of royalty income allocable to A based on its incorrect belief that A is entitled to a reduced rate of withholding under the U.S.-Country A Income Tax Treaty. In 2020, the IRS determines in an examination of Partnership's Form 1042, Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source Income of Foreign Persons, that Partnership should have withheld $30 instead of $15 on the $100 of royalty income allocable to A because Partnership failed to obtain documentation from A establishing a valid treaty claim for a reduced rate of withholding. The rate of withholding on the income allocable to A is not an item of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Therefore, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the adjustment to increase Partnership's withholding tax liability by $15 is not determined under subchapter C of chapter 63, and instead must be determined as part of the Form 1042 examination.","doc_id":"[FR Doc. 2017-25740 Filed 11-29-17; 8:45 am]","end":741,"key":"treaty","order_code":130,"phrase":"Income Tax Treaty","start":724,"title":"Centralized Partnership Audit Regime: International Tax Rules","type":"prorule"},{"agency":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION","content":"These helicopters have been approved by the aviation authority of Italy and are approved for operation in the United States.

Paragraph (c) of License Exception GOV authorizes certain exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) to agencies of cooperating governments or agencies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Paragraph (c)(1) defines `Agency of a cooperating government' for purposes of this paragraph of License Exception GOV. This final rule adds a new note to paragraph (c)(1) of License Exception GOV to clarify that civil intergovernmental organizations in which the membership is limited to national governments that are `cooperating governments' are also considered `cooperating governments' for purposes of paragraph (c)(1). The new note provides an example of a civil intergovernmental organization, the European Space Agency (ESA), which BIS has determined to fall within the scope of the definition of `cooperating governments.' ESA (and other civil intergovernmental organizations) are considered `cooperating governments' because their membership is limited to `cooperating governments'\u2014meaning that if an export was made directly to any of organization's national government members, License Exception GOV would be available. On this basis, BIS does not exclude exports, reexports and transfers (in-country) made to ESA (and any other civil intergovernmental organization whose members are `cooperating governments') from License Exception GOV. The purpose of this paragraph (c)(1) is to clarify that the fact that two or more `cooperating governments' are working together does not change the policy rationale for why the United States Government intends to authorize such exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country). However, this final rule adds a second sentence to the note to paragraph (c)(1) to clarify that if the membership of the civil intergovernmental organization involves any national governments or other organizations that are not `cooperating governments,' such civil intergovernmental organizations are not considered cooperating governments for purposes of paragraph (c)(1), and a third sentence to provide three illustrative examples of civil intergovernmental organizations that are excluded based on this criteria. This third sentence also clarifies that this exclusion applies even when some or all of the `cooperating governments' are members of the civil intergovernmental organization. This final rule provides the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the United Nations, and the World Bank as three examples of civil intergovernmental organizations that include members that are `cooperating governments' along with members that are not `cooperating governments,' with the inclusion of the latter group meaning that these civil intergovernmental organizations are not within the scope of paragraph (c)(1).","doc_id":"[FR Doc. 2017-23712 Filed 10-31-17; 8:45 am]","end":225,"key":"treaty","order_code":27,"phrase":"North Atlantic Treaty Organization","start":191,"title":"Clarifications to the Export Administration Regulations for the Use of License Exceptions","type":"rule"},{"agency":"DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE","content":" Governments, International Organizations, International Inspections under the Chemical Weapons Convention, and the International Space Station (GOV).","doc_id":"[FR Doc. 2017-23712 Filed 10-31-17; 8:45 am]","end":106,"key":"convention","order_code":60,"phrase":"Chemical Weapons Convention","start":79,"title":"Clarifications to the Export Administration Regulations for the Use of License Exceptions","type":"rule"},{"agency":"DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY","content":"In addition, CBP proposed technical updates to paragraph (g) of 19 CFR 24.22 to reflect the elimination of the user fee exemption for passengers arriving from Canada, Mexico or one of the adjacent islands pursuant to the United States\u2014Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act.

In 2015 and 2016, fifteen and eighteen vessels fished in the Convention Area, respectively.","doc_id":"[FR Doc. 2017-24606 Filed 11-13-17; 8:45 am]","end":344,"key":"treaty","order_code":65,"phrase":"South Pacific Tuna Treaty","start":319,"title":"International Fisheries; Pacific Tuna Fisheries; Fishing Restrictions for Tropical Tuna in the Eastern Pacific Ocean for 2018 to 2020","type":"prorule"},{"agency":"DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE","content":"(iv) Any purse seine vessel for which a force majeure request is accepted by the IATTC, must carry an observer aboard authorized pursuant to the International Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Program.","doc_id":"[FR Doc. 2017-24606 Filed 11-13-17; 8:45 am]","end":168,"key":"international agreement","order_code":138,"phrase":"international agreement","start":145,"title":"International Fisheries; Pacific Tuna Fisheries; Fishing Restrictions for Tropical Tuna in the Eastern Pacific Ocean for 2018 to 2020","type":"prorule"},{"agency":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION","content":"This product has been approved by the aviation authority of the United Kingdom, and is approved for operation in the United States.

Regarding the first factor, if the proportion of the fleet that has fishery endorsements changes from the proportion during the baseline period, the likelihood of the ELAPs limit being reached would change accordingly (if the proportion increases, the likelihood would increase). However, because fishing in the U.S. EEZ makes up a relatively small portion of all fishing in the ELAPS, this is a relatively minor factor, and is not examined any further here. Regarding the second factor, the eastern areas of the WCPO have tended to be comparatively more attractive to the U.S. purse seine fleet during El Nino events (versus other times), when warm surface water spreads from the western Pacific to the eastern Pacific and large, valuable yellowfin become more vulnerable to purse seine fishing. Consequently, the ELAPS, much of which is situated in the eastern range of the fleet's fishing grounds, is likely to be more important fishing grounds to the fleet during El Nino events (as compared to neutral or La Nina events). According to the National Weather Service ((see www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov\/products\/analysis_monitoring\/enso_advisory\/index.shtml), as of June 2017, conditions were ENSO-neutral and the forecast was that ENSO-neutral conditions are favored through the second half of 2017. The 35-50 percent chance of an El Nino developing in the fall of 2017 suggests a slight chance that fishing in the ELAPS could become more important in the latter half of the year, but would only slightly increase the likelihood (than indicated by fishing effort alone) of the proposed 2017 ELAPS limit being reached. Regarding the third factor, effective January 1, 2017, a new treaty is in place between U.S. purse seine vessel owners and the members of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) that allows the U.S. fleet the opportunity to purchase fishing days for use in the EEZs of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA, a subset of eight FFA members in whose waters most WCPO tropical purse seine fishing occurs), and in the EEZs of the other FFA members during the period of the arrangement, which is through 2022). Under the new treaty, vessels notify the U.S. government which in turn informs FFA of the number of treaty days each vessel or group of vessels desires to purchase. These days can be traded among vessels participating in the treaty, and vessels may purchase additional bilateral days during the agreement period if additional days are desired. As each vessel decides on the number of fishing days it wishes to purchase, and vessels can trade and purchase additional bilateral days, it appears that there is a relatively small likelihood of all of the EEZs of the FFA members becoming unavailable to the U.S. fleet before the end of 2017. It is possible that vessels that purchase more treaty days may rely less on the use of ELAPS days whereas vessels that purchase fewer treaty days may rely more heavily on the use of ELAPS days. Regarding the fourth factor, vessels may also choose to fish outside the Convention Area in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO). Historically, the fleet fished very little in the EPO, but the numbers of U.S. purse seine vessels fishing in the EPO has been steadily increasing since 2014. Vessels fishing in the EPO are required to be on the IATTC Vessel Register, and can either apply to be on the active purse seine capacity list where they can fish in the EPO during the calendar year or request to use one fishing trip in the EPO that an SPTT-licensed vessel is allowed to make, not to exceed 90 days in length, and there is an annual limit of 32 trips for the entire SPTT-licensed fleet (50 CFR 300.22(b)(1)). If vessels choose to fish in the EPO, this could influence the number of ELAPS days they use, particularly if they opt to fish in the overlap area between the WCPFC and IATTC where their effort would count against the ELAPS limit or fish outside of the area of the overlap where their effort would not count against the ELAPS limit. As of June 2017, 17 U.S. purse seine vessels with WCPFC Area Endorsements are also on the IATTC active purse seine register for 2017.","doc_id":"[FR Doc. 2017-19981 Filed 9-19-17; 8:45 am]","end":323,"key":"treaty","order_code":67,"phrase":"South Pacific Tuna Treaty","start":298,"title":"International Fisheries; Western and Central Pacific Fisheries for Highly Migratory Species; Fishing Limits in Purse Seine Fisheries for 2017","type":"prorule"},{"agency":"DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE","content":"This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 986 (7 CFR part 986), regulating the handling of pecans grown in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Texas, hereinafter referred to as the \u201corder.\u201d The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the \u201cAct.\u201d","doc_id":"[FR Doc. 2017-19554 Filed 9-18-17; 8:45 am]","end":413,"key":"agreement","order_code":17,"phrase":"Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act","start":377,"title":"Pecans Grown in the States of Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Texas; Establishment of Assessment Rates","type":"rule"},{"agency":"DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY","content":"On September 19, 1997, the United States entered into a bilateral agreement with Mali that continued without interruption the import restrictions previously placed on the same archaeological material.

The number of size class 6 purse seine vessels on the IATTC Regional Vessel Register has increased substantially in the past three years, due in part to uncertainty regarding fishing access pursuant to the Treaty on Fisheries between the Governments of Certain Pacific Island States and the Government of the United States of America (aka the South Pacific Tuna Treaty), for which negotiations were concluded in 2016. Size class 6 purse seine vessels land most of the yellowfin, skipjack, and bigeye tuna catch in the EPO. Ex-vessel price information for class size 6 purse seine vessels that fished exclusively in the EPO in 2015 and 2016 specific to the individual vessels are not available to NMFS because these vessels did not land on the U.S. West Coast, and the cannery receipts are not available through the IATTC. However, estimates for large purse seine vessels based in the WCPO that fish in both the EPO and WCPO may be used as a proxy for U.S. large purse seine vessels. The number of these U.S. purse seine vessels is approximated by the number with Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) Area Endorsements, which are the NMFS-issued authorizations required to fish commercially for highly migratory species (HMS) on the high seas in the WCPFC Convention Area. As of May 2017, the number of purse seine vessels with WCPFC Area Endorsements was 37. Neither gross receipts nor ex-vessel price information specific to individual fishing vessels are available to NMFS, so NMFS applied indicative regional cannery prices\u2014as approximations of ex-vessel prices\u2014to annual catches of individual vessels to estimate their annual receipts. Indicative regional cannery prices are available through 2014 (developed by the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency; available at https:\/\/www.ffa.int\/node\/425).

However, the 2017 abundance forecast for this stock is very low; 6,548 fish compared to a 2009-2016 average of 18,700 fish. The FMP's conservation objective for Queets coho is a spawning escapement of 5,800 fish. Although the Council's recommended management measures would allow for an ocean escapement of 5,800 Queets coho, the conservation objective in the FMP is for a spawning escapement that accounts for in-river fishery impacts. The FMP provides flexibility in setting the annual spawning escapement for several Washington coho stocks, including Queets coho, provided there is agreement between the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) and the treaty tribes, consistent with court orders in U.S. v Washington. Therefore, based on agreement between those parties and discussion on the Council floor that the reduced spawning escapement is unlikely to jeopardize the capacity of the fishery to produce maximum sustainable yield on a continuing basis, the Council adopted a 2017 spawning escapement target of 5,130 Queets coho to allow for limited harvest opportunity in ocean and in-river fisheries directed at other higher-abundance stocks.

The state and treaty tribal co-managers relied on a provision in the PST to request that the Southern Panel of the Pacific Salmon Commission agree to permit a 22 percent exploitation rate on Queets coho in 2017 to allow the U.S. to meet fishery management objectives [(Pacific Salmon Treaty, Article XV, Annex IV, Chapter 5, paragraph 11(c)]. The Southern Panel did agree to this request. Managing for impacts to Queets coho will constrain salmon fisheries north of Cape Falcon, Oregon.","doc_id":"[FR Doc. 2017-08638 Filed 4-27-17; 8:45 am]","end":1684,"key":"treaty","order_code":38,"phrase":"Pacific Salmon Treaty","start":1663,"title":"Fisheries Off West Coast States; West Coast Salmon Fisheries; 2017 Management Measures and a Temporary Rule","type":"rule"},{"agency":"DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE","content":"Section 3.

The Commission seeks comment on whether the process can be revised in a manner that would permit applicants to self-certify their compliance with the Commission's Section 106 process and therefore proceed once they meet the Commission's notification requirements, without requiring Commission involvement, in a manner analogous to the \u201cdeemed granted\u201d remedy for local governments.

As part of the effort to expedite further the process for deployment of wireless facilities, including small facility deployments in particular, the Commission seeks comment below on whether it should expand the categories of undertakings that are excluded from Section 106 review. With respect to each of the potential exclusions discussed below, the Commission seeks comment on the alternatives of adopting additional exclusions directly in the Commission's rules, or incorporating into the Commission's rules a program alternative pursuant to the ACHP rules. The Commission may exclude activities from Section 106 review through rulemaking upon determining that they have no potential to cause effects to historic properties, assuming such properties are present. Where potential effects are foreseeable and likely to be minimal or not adverse, a program alternative under the ACHP's rules may be used to exclude activities from Section 106 review. The Commission seeks comment about whether the exclusions discussed below meet the test for an exclusion in 36 CFR 800.3(a)(1) or whether they would require a program alternative. To the extent that a program alternative would be necessary, the Commission seeks comment on which of the program alternatives authorized under the ACHP's rules would be appropriate. Particularly, for those potential exclusions where a program alternative would be required, commenters should discuss whether a new program alternative is necessary or whether an amendment to the NPA or a second amendment to the Collocation NPA would be the appropriate procedural mechanism (See Wireless Telecommunications Bureau Announces Execution of First Amendment to the Nationwide Programmatic Agreement for the Collocation of Wireless Antennas, Public Notice, 31 FCC Rcd 4617 (WTB 2016) (Collocation NPA)).","doc_id":"[FR Doc. 2017-09431 Filed 5-9-17; 8:45 am]","end":1729,"key":"agreement","order_code":85,"phrase":"Nationwide Programmatic Agreement","start":1696,"title":"Accelerating Wireless Broadband Deployment by Removing Barriers to Infrastructure Investment","type":"prorule"},{"agency":"FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION","content":"48. The Commission seeks comment on whether to expand the NPA exemption from Section 106 review for construction of wireless facilities in rights of way. First, as noted above, current provisions of the NPA exclude from Section 106 review construction in utility and communications rights of way subject to certain limitations. The Commission seeks comment on whether to adopt a similar exclusion from Section 106 review for construction or collocation of communications infrastructure in transportation rights of way and whether such an exclusion would be warranted under 36 CFR 800.3(a)(1). The Commission recognizes the Commission's previous determination in the NPA Order that, given the concentration of historic properties near many highways and railroads, it was not feasible to draft an exclusion for transportation corridors that would both significantly ease the burdens of the Section 106 process and sufficiently protect historic properties (See Nationwide Programmatic Agreement Regarding the Section 106 National Historic Preservation Act Review Process, Report and Order, 20 FCC Rcd 1073 (2004) (NPA Order)).

Rick Santorum for President, FEC Form 3P at 4 (Jan. 31, 2012), http:\/\/docquery.fec.gov\/pdf\/317\/12950383317\/12950383317.pdf. While not all of these disbursements were targeted to Iowa, the candidate's total spending in relation to the caucuses in that state was far higher than $21,980. Even looking at only reported disbursements to Iowa payees (and, therefore, not including payments to media buyers and others outside of Iowa for activities targeted towards Iowa), the filings shows that Santorum spent over $112,000 in Iowa between October 1 and December 31, 2011, for purposes including rent, payroll, lodging, direct mail, advertising, communication consulting, and coalition building. Id. Thus, the Schoen Report's use of unexplained second-hand analysis undercuts its credibility, and the facts demonstrated by the public record give the Commission reason to doubt the Schoen Report's calculations regarding any extra benefit major party primary candidates receive from their media expenditures.","doc_id":"[FR Doc. 2017-06150 Filed 3-28-17; 8:45 am]","end":855,"key":"convention","order_code":50,"phrase":"Democratic National Convention","start":825,"title":"Candidate Debates","type":"prorule"},{"agency":"DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE","content":"22.

It also provides for recognition of adoptions that occur pursuant to the Convention. In the United States, the implementing legislation for the Hague Convention is the Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000 (IAA). To implement the Convention, the IAA makes two significant changes to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA): (1) It creates a new definition of \u201cchild\u201d applicable in Convention adoption cases, found at INA 101(b)(1)(G), that roughly parallels the current definition of \u201cchild\u201d in INA 101(b)(1)(F) with respect to an orphan, but that applies only to children being adopted from Convention countries. (2) It incorporates Hague procedures into the immigration process for children covered by INA 101(b)(1)(G), most directly by precluding approval of an immigration petition under this classification until the Department has certified that the child was adopted (or legal custody was granted for purposes of emigration and adoption) in accordance with the Convention and the IAA.

Concerns began to mount with regard to the threat of pollution to environmental resources and were first addressed in 1965 with the Solid Waste Disposal Act and the Water Resources Planning Act. In 1970 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) was established to \u201cprotect human health and safeguard the natural environment\u201d. Currently there are numerous International, Federal, and State regulations that reduce the threats of contaminants to environmental resources such as the American eel. The 1972 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement was signed between the U.S. and Canada to \u201crestore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the waters of the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem\u201d. In addition, Canada also has authority to manage water resources and control pollution under two primary acts, the Ontario Water Resources Act and the Environmental Protection Act. Federal regulations that address environmental contaminants include the Water Pollution Control Act and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act of 1972, Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, Clean Water Act and the Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act of 1977, Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.

The flow management objectives considered by the Supreme Court Decree of 1954 were narrower than the diverse objectives that have emerged in the decades since. Today, the finite waters of the Delaware, and the limited storage available in the basin are being managed for multiple purposes, including among others water supply and drought mitigation, flood mitigation, and habitat protection in the tailwaters fishery, the mainstem and the estuary. In accordance with the Delaware River Basin Compact, a statute concurrently enacted in 1961 by the U.S. Government and the four basin States\u2014Delaware, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania\u2014the Delaware River Basin Commission may modify diversions, releases, rights, conditions and obligations established by the decree, provided that the decree parties unanimously consent to such modifications. The Commission and decree parties have made use of this authority to provide flexibility to respond to fluctuating hydrologic conditions and evolving priorities throughout the Commission's history. In 1983, in accordance with an agreement among the parties known as the \u201cGood Faith Agreement,\u201d a reservoir release regime was established on a permanent basis to supplement the provisions of the decree for the limited purpose of protecting and enhancing the tailwaters fishery. Since the adoption of this regime in the form of a docket (similar to a permit) issued to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation\u2014Docket D-77-20 CP (Revised)\u2014the \u201cfishery management program\u201d as the plan is sometimes called, has been modified repeatedly by the Commission with the unanimous consent of the decree parties.

Specifically, he asserts that AM IBOC interference is in contravention of the article in that agreement which states: \u201cClasses of emission other than A3E, for instance to accommodate stereophonic systems, could also be used on condition that the energy level outside the necessary bandwidth does not exceed that normally expected in A3E. * * *.\u201d McLarnon asserts that the \u201cnecessary bandwidth\u201d in this case is defined as 10 kHz and the hybrid AM IBOC system increases the occupied bandwidth of an AM station to approximately 28 kHz.

The GB cod TAC calculation is based upon the historic cod landings of the participating Sector vessels, regardless of gear used.  The allocation percentage is calculated by dividing the sum of total landings of GB cod landed by Sector members in FY 1996 through 2001, by the sum of the total accumulated landings of GB cod landed by all NE multispecies vessels for the same time period (10,738,834 lb (4,871.1 mt)\/113,278,842 lb (51,382.42 mt)).  Based upon the 35 prospective Sector members, the Sector TAC of GB cod would be 798 mt (9.48 percent times the fishery-wide GB cod target TAC of 8,416 mt).  The fishery-wide GB cod target TAC of 8,416 mt is less than the total GB cod target TAC proposed for FY 2007 (9,822 mt) because the 9,822 mt includes Canadian catch.  If prospective members of the Sector  determine that they no longer want to participate in the sector after the publication of this document and prior to a final decision by the Regional Administrator, it is possible that the total number of participants in the Sector and the TAC for the Sector may differ from the numbers above.   The Sector Agreement contains procedures for the enforcement of the Sector rules, a schedule of penalties, and provides the authority to the Sector Manager to issue stop fishing orders to members of the Sector.  Participating vessels would be required to land fish only in designated landing ports and would be required to provide the Sector Manager with a copy of the Vessel Trip Report (VTR) within 48 hr of offloading.  Dealers purchasing fish from participating vessels would be required to provide the Sector Manager with a copy of the dealer report on a weekly basis.  On a monthly basis, the Sector Manager would transmit to NMFS a copy of the VTRs and the aggregate catch information from these reports.  After 90 percent of the Sector's allocation has been harvested, the Sector Manager would be required to provide NMFS with aggregate reports on a weekly basis.  A total of 1\/12 of the Sector's GB cod TAC, minus a reserve, would be allocated to each month of the fishing year.  GB cod quota that is not landed during a given month would be rolled over into the following month.  Once the aggregate monthly quota of GB cod is reached, for the remainder of the month, participating vessels could not fish under a NE multispecies DAS, possess or land GB cod or other regulated species, or use gear capable of catching regulated NE multispecies.  Once the annual TAC of GB cod is reached, Sector members could not fish under a NE multispecies DAS, possess or land GB cod or other regulated species, or use gear capable of catching regulated NE multispecies for the rest of the fishing year.   The harvest rules would not preclude vessels from fishing under the charter\/party or recreational regulations, provided the vessel fishes under the applicable charter\/party and recreational rules on separate trips.  For each fishing trip, participating vessels would be required to fish under the NE multispecies DAS program to account for any incidental groundfish species that they may catch while fishing for GB cod.  In addition, participating vessels would be required to call the Sector Manager prior to leaving port.  All legal-sized cod caught would be retained and landed and counted against the Sector's aggregate allocation.  Participating vessels would not be allowed to fish with or have on board gear other than jigs, non-automated demersal longline, or handgear.  NE multispecies DAS used by participating vessels while conducting fishery research under an Exempted Fishing Permit during the FY 2007 would be deducted from that Sector member's individual DAS allocation.  Similarly, all GB cod landed by a participating vessel while conducting research would count toward the Sector's allocation of GB cod TAC.  Participating vessels would be exempt from the GB Seasonal Closure Area during May.","doc_id":"[FR Doc. 07-1883 Filed 4-12-07; 10:41 am]","end":1216,"key":"agreement","order_code":31,"phrase":"The Sector Agreement","start":1196,"title":"Magnuson-Stevens Act Provisions; Fisheries of the Northeastern United States; Northeast Multispecies Fishery; 2007 Georges Bank Cod Hook Sector Operations Plan and Agreement and Allocation of Georges Bank Cod Total Allowable Catch","type":"prorule"},{"agency":"DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ","content":"One commenter took issue with our statement that CWR is not established in the United States.

Successful negotiation of that agreement is a critical first step to achieving the benefits to public safety under the Frontline proposal.

The final rule emphasizes the need to consider worker and road user safety as an integral part of each agency's process for considering and managing the overall impacts due to work zones on Federal-aid highway projects. As noted previously, a recent synthesis of positive protection practices in highway work zones indicates that a wide range of positive protection devices and other safety treatments are already being used by State highway agencies. This synthesis found that among positive protective devices, portable concrete barriers and SV\/TMAs were being used by nearly every State highway agency. The FHWA believes that positive protection devices and other safety treatments are also widely used by many local agencies because the FHWA's research indicates that local agencies usually follow State practice with respect to MUTCD guidance. As such, any additional usage of positive protection devices resulting from the proposed action would be incremental to what many local highway agencies are already using to address work zone safety. In addition, consideration of exposure control and other traffic control measures that would avoid or minimize worker exposure to motorized traffic may decrease the overall need for positive protection devices.

The Vermont Project XL regulations were originally authorized by the EPA and became part of the Federally enforceable VT RCRA program on October 26, 2000. See 65 FR 64164. Specifically, we are now authorizing an extension of approximately two and a half years to April 15, 2009. EPA amended its Federal regulations to extend the expiration date of the XL Project from September 30, 2006 to a new date of April 15, 2009. See 71 FR 35547. The State has adopted an extension of six years to September 30, 2012. The EPA is only able to authorize the extension for two and a half years at this time, but could consider another Federal extension should a longer one prove necessary. EPA believes an extension is appropriate since it has recently proposed a national set of alternative regulations for academic laboratories (see 71 FR 29712, May 23, 2006) and, pending promulgation of a national rule, the extension will allow the universities currently participating in the Labs XL Project to continue to build upon the successes of the project and not have to terminate their participation in the Project. The current extension of the expiration date also should be accompanied by an updated Final Project Agreement (FPA) for this XL Project. We anticipate that the FPA will be updated (for this interstate Vermont-Massachusetts project) by the time that the EPA authorizes the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for changes it will be making to its hazardous waste program regulations.

The interim rule, if applied to a proclamation suspending the entry of aliens who cross the southern border unlawfully, would bar such aliens from eligibility for asylum and thereby channel inadmissible aliens to ports of entry, where they would be processed in a controlled, orderly, and lawful manner.

After determining the alien's ineligibility for asylum under the credible-fear standard, the asylum officer would apply the long-established reasonable-fear standard to assess whether further proceedings on a possible statutory withholding or CAT protection claim are warranted. If the asylum officer determined that the alien had not established the requisite reasonable fear, the alien then could seek review of that decision from an immigration judge (just as the alien may under existing 8 CFR 208.30 and 208.31), and would be subject to removal only if the immigration judge agreed with the negative reasonable-fear finding. Conversely, if either the asylum officer or the immigration judge determined that the alien cleared the reasonable-fear threshold, the alien would be put in section 240 proceedings, just like aliens who receive a positive credible-fear determination for asylum.

Therefore, take of an eastern black rail, its chicks, or its eggs that is incidental to another lawful activity does not violate the MBTA. Furthermore, the MBTA does not address the major stressors affecting the eastern black rail, which include habitat alteration and sea level rise.

Both the Buy American statute and section 858 allow a determination not to utilize a domestic product if the cost of the domestic product is unreasonable. With regard to determining that the cost of a domestic item is unreasonable, Executive Order 10582, Prescribing Uniform Procedures for Certain Determinations under the Buy-American Act, provides a methodology to determine unreasonable cost, using a minimum differential of 6 percent, but also provides that the head of an executive agency may determine that the use of a higher differential between the cost of materials of domestic origin and the cost of materials of foreign origin \u201cis not unreasonable.\u201d The then Secretary of Defense, Cyrus Vance, signed a memorandum on May 7, 1964, providing for application of a 50 percent differential under the Buy American statute. Therefore, DoD proposes to continue application of a 50 percent evaluation factor when determining whether the price of domestic photovoltaic devices is unreasonable when the estimated aggregate value of the photovoltaic devices to be utilized is less than $180,000 (the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement threshold). The application of an evaluation factor to foreign products to determine whether the price of domestic products is reasonable is not applicable when the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement applies, because there is a prohibition under that agreement to buying any products that are not designated, domestic, U.S.-made, or qualifying country products. DoD has waived the application of the Buy American statute to U.S.-made products so no evaluation factor is applicable.","doc_id":"[FR Doc. 2018-18240 Filed 8-23-18; 8:45 am]","end":1195,"key":"agreement","order_code":40,"phrase":"World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement","start":1138,"title":"Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement: Sunset of Provision Relating to the Procurement of Certain Goods (DFARS Case 2018-D007)","type":"prorule"},{"agency":"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE","content":"(1) Free Trade Agreements.

The NPRM sought comment on the combination of activities that should be required to qualify as incubation and whether there should be any conditions or limitations on the financial and operational aspects of a qualifying incubation relationship. Noting that proponents had previously proposed that an incubator program include management or technical assistance, loan guarantees, direct financial assistance through loans or equity investment, training, and business planning assistance, the NPRM asked whether the program should also include other activities, such as donating stations to certain organizations or arrangements whereby a new entrant gains operational experience without first acquiring a station (e.g., pursuant to a Local Marketing Agreement (LMA)). In addition, the NPRM asked what additional safeguards the Commission should include in order to ensure that the incubated station licensee retains control of its station. We conclude that qualifying incubation relationships are those in which an experienced AM or FM broadcaster provides an eligible new or small broadcaster with support that it cannot obtain on its own and that is essential to its ability to independently own and operate a full-service AM or FM station. We expect qualifying incubation relationships to provide the incubated entity with financial and operational support (including management training) that it needs and that will ultimately enable the incubated entity to own and operate independently either the incubated full-service AM or FM station or another full-service AM or FM station acquired at the completion of the program. We allow parties the flexibility to tailor each proposed incubation relationship to the specific needs of the incubated entity while adopting certain safeguards to ensure that the incubated entity retains full control of the incubated station.","doc_id":"[FR Doc. 2018-18289 Filed 8-27-18; 8:45 am]","end":763,"key":"agreement","order_code":54,"phrase":"Local Marketing Agreement","start":738,"title":"Rules and Policies To Promote New Entry and Ownership Diversity in the Broadcasting Services","type":"rule"},{"agency":"DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE","content":"This action, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, proposes an amendment to regulations issued to carry out a marketing order as defined in 7 CFR 900.2(j).

Extinguishing internal lights of buildings at night, avoiding the use of external floodlighting, and shielding the upward radiation of low-level lighting such as street lamps are expected to reduce attraction and trapping of birds within illuminated urban areas, and in turn, injury and mortality caused by collision, predation, starvation, or exhaustion (reviewed in Ogden 1996, p. 31). The Service's Urban Conservation Treaty for Migratory Birds program has worked with several cities to adopt projects that benefit migrating birds flying through urban areas in between breeding and wintering grounds. For example, some cities within the Kirtland's warbler's migration corridor, such as Chicago, Indianapolis, Columbus, Detroit, and Milwaukee, have \u201cLights Out\u201d or similar programs, which encourage the owners and managers of tall buildings to turn off or dim exterior decorative lights as well as interior lights during spring and fall migration periods (http:\/\/www.audubon.org\/conservation\/existing-lights-out-programs).

This history suggests a relatively low likelihood of the proposed EEZ limit being reached in 2018-2020. However, the allowance for an extra 100 fishing days if the 458 fishing days are used by October 1 could provide an incentive for the fleet to use more fishing days in the EEZ than it otherwise would. Furthermore, this would be the first time that separate limits would be established for the EEZ and the high seas, so the incentives for individual vessels in the fleet would change.

Small entities that do participate in the distance education sector may benefit from avoiding these fees during the delay period. If 50 percent of small entities offer distance education, the average annual cost savings per small entity during the delay would be approximately $3,280, but that would increase to $6,560 if distance education was only offered by 25 percent of small entities.

The stock assessment conclusions differ significantly and unexpectedly from the most recent previous assessments, which had indicated that the stock was not overfished or experiencing overfishing. The new assessment indicates that dramatic immediate reductions in fishing mortality are needed to end overfishing of this stock, and this action is needed to address this serious conservation problem (Criteria 2). Finally, the immediate benefits to the shortfin mako shark resource and our need to meet obligations under the Magnuson-Stevens Act and Atlantic Tunas Convention Act outweigh the value of the advance notice and public comments provided under the normal rulemaking process (Criteria 3). Without an emergency rule to implement these measures, the reported U.S. catches at the end of the ICCAT six-month reporting period (ending at the end of June 2018) would reflect catches under the existing management practices and thus not reflect whether the new measures were effective to address overfishing.

The recent unforeseen circumstances described above, and need for expedient action, make it impracticable to provide prior notice-and-comment opportunity and a 30-day delay. The new stock assessment for Atlantic shortfin mako sharks was completed in August 2017 and accepted in November by ICCAT and December 2017 by NMFS, revealing that the North Atlantic shortfin mako shark stock is overfished, with overfishing occurring. ICCAT developed Recommendation 17-08 at its annual meeting in November 2017, which the United States must implement as necessary and appropriate under the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act. It would be potentially harmful to the long-term sustainability of the resource to implement these measures through notice-and-comment rulemaking because immediate reductions in fishing mortality are needed to address overfishing and begin to rebuild the stock and data will be re-evaluated as soon as November 2018 to determine whether additional measures are needed. Unless the new measures are in place, they cannot be properly evaluated for effectiveness in the fall and ICCAT will not be able to determine whether additional measures are immediately needed. Additionally, affected fishing vessel owners should not require time to adjust to these regulations, as the regulations do not constitute substantive operational changes, such as changes to equipment that might require time for purchasing and installation, or changes to practices that might require special training. Here, the rule only affects the landing of a particular species, and thus vessel owners should be able to understand and implement the changes immediately.

The manner in which the essential objectives are addressed by the Agreement States need not be the same as the NRC's, provided the essential objectives are met. Because the essential objectives are met for personnel dosimetry (i.e., personnel dosimetry is used to determine an individual's dose of record), several Agreement States have allowed the use of digital output personnel dosimeters to meet the monitoring requirements for industrial radiography and other areas. In accepting Issue 1, the NRC intends to expand the availability of digital output personnel dosimeters to licensees licensed under 10 CFR parts 34, 36, and 39 and not impede the current use of the dosimetry by Agreement State licensees, including reciprocity activities in NRC jurisdictions.","doc_id":"[FR Doc. 2019-01792 Filed 2-8-19; 8:45 am]","end":80,"key":"agreement","order_code":99,"phrase":"Agreement State Program","start":57,"title":"Individual Monitoring Devices for Industrial Radiographic Personnel","type":"prorule"},{"agency":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION","content":"The United States has bilateral aviation agreements with numerous foreign countries for the acceptance of aeronautical products for export and import.

Therefore, the State of Vermont has committed to adopting an adequate and compatible set of radiation protection regulations that apply to byproduct materials, source material and special nuclear material in quantities not sufficient to form a critical mass. The NRC staff also verified that the State of Vermont will not attempt to enforce regulatory matters reserved to the Commission.","doc_id":"[FR Doc. 2019-13403 Filed 6-24-19; 8:45 am]","end":845,"key":"agreement","order_code":61,"phrase":"Agreement State Application","start":818,"title":"State of Vermont: NRC Staff Assessment of a Proposed Agreement Between the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the State of Vermont","type":"prorule"},{"agency":"NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION","content":"The NRC staff has reviewed the proposed Agreement, the certification of Vermont Governor Scott, and the supporting information provided by the Radioactive Materials Program of the Vermont Department of Health.

After determining the alien's ineligibility for asylum under the credible-fear standard, the asylum officer would apply the long-established reasonable-fear standard to assess whether further proceedings on a possible statutory withholding or CAT protection claim are warranted. If the asylum officer determined that the alien had not established the requisite reasonable fear, the alien then could seek review of that decision from an immigration judge (just as the alien may under existing 8 CFR 208.30 and 208.31), and would be subject to removal only if the immigration judge agreed with the negative reasonable-fear finding. Conversely, if either the asylum officer or the immigration judge determined that the alien cleared the reasonable-fear threshold, the alien would be put in section 240 proceedings, just like aliens who receive a positive credible-fear determination for asylum. Employing a reasonable-fear standard in this context, for this category of ineligible aliens, would be consistent with DOJ's longstanding rationale that \u201caliens ineligible for asylum,\u201d who could only be granted statutory withholding of removal or CAT protection, should be subject to a different screening standard that would correspond to the higher bar for actually obtaining these forms of protection.

L. 95-224, Feb. 3, 1978). Per OMB guidance (43 FR 36860, August 18, 1978), the basic statutory criterion for distinguishing between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, substantial involvement is anticipated between the executive agency and the grantee during performance of the contemplated activity. The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) further describes \u201csubstantial involvement\u201d is a relative, rather than an absolute, concept, and that it is primarily based on programmatic factors, rather than requirements for grant or cooperative agreement award or administration. For example, substantial involvement may include collaboration, participation, or intervention in the program or activity to be performed under the award (32 CFR 22.215(b)). Grants.gov also addresses that, in general terms, \u201csubstantial involvement\u201d refers to the degree to which Federal employees are directly performing or implementing parts of the award program. In a grant, the Federal Government more strictly maintains an oversight and monitoring role. In a cooperative agreement, Federal employees participate more closely in performing the program.

Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b), the Administrative Procedure Act allows an agency to make a rule effective without a proposed rule for good cause if \u201ccontrary to the public interest.\u201d We find that the delay associated with public comment on a proposed rule to open the Alaska migratory bird subsistence harvest by April 2 is contrary to the public interest, and therefore the \u201cgood cause\u201d exception under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) applies.","doc_id":"[FR Doc. 2019-06585 Filed 4-1-19; 4:15 pm]","end":346,"key":"treaty","order_code":36,"phrase":"Migratory Bird Treaty Act","start":321,"title":"Migratory Bird Subsistence Harvest in Alaska; Harvest Regulations for Migratory Birds in Alaska During the 2019 Season","type":"rule"},{"agency":"DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR","content":"Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act; Religious Use of Feathers","doc_id":"[FR Doc. 2019-08280 Filed 4-29-19; 8:45 am]","end":66,"key":"treaty","order_code":4,"phrase":"Migratory Bird Treaty Act","start":41,"title":"Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act; Religious Use of Feathers","type":"prorule"},{"agency":"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE","content":"DoD is amending the DFARS to remove DFARS clause 252.204-7005, Oral Attestation of Security Responsibilities, and the associated clause prescription at DFARS 204.404-70.

In addition, requests to be added to the Vessel Register have exceeded the available IATTC-allotted capacity limit for the U.S. Uncertainty and an increase in the cost of fishing in other areas (e.g., the western central Pacific Ocean under the South Pacific Tuna Treaty) has led to an increase in the number of large purse seine vessels (i.e., greater than 362.8 metric tons (mt) carrying capacity) seeking fishing access in the Convention Area.

The number of large purse seine vessels on the Vessel Register has increased substantially in the past five years. This was due in part to uncertainty regarding fishing access pursuant to the Treaty on Fisheries between the Governments of Certain Pacific Island States and the Government of the United States of America (the South Pacific Tuna Treaty). Negotiations for an amended South Pacific Tuna Treaty were concluded in 2016. In 2018, sixteen large purse seine vessels went on 38 fishing trips during which some part of the fishing activity occurred in the EPO. Large purse seine vessels land most of the yellowfin, skipjack, and bigeye tuna catch in the EPO. Ex-vessel price information for large purse seine vessels that fished exclusively in the EPO in 2018 is not available to NMFS, because these vessels did not land on the U.S. West Coast, and the cannery receipts are not available through the IATTC. However, estimates for ex-vessel price information for large purse seine vessels based in the WCPO that fish in both the EPO and WCPO may be used as a proxy for U.S. large purse seine vessels. The number of these U.S. purse seine vessels is approximated by the number with Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) Area Endorsements, which are the NMFS-issued authorizations required to fish commercially for tuna and tuna-like species on the high seas in the WCPFC Convention Area. As of March 2019, the number of purse seine vessels with WCPFC Area Endorsements was 33. Neither gross receipts nor ex-vessel price information specific to individual fishing vessels fishing in the WCPO and EPO are available to NMFS, so NMFS applied indicative regional cannery prices of the WCPO\u2014as approximations of ex-vessel prices\u2014to annual catches of individual vessels to estimate their annual receipts. Indicative regional cannery prices are available through 2014 (developed by the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency; available at https:\/\/www.ffa.int\/node\/425). NMFS estimated vessels' annual receipts during 2012 through 2014. Using this approach, NMFS estimates that among the affected vessels, the range in annual average receipts per vessel in 2012 through 2014 was $3 million to $20 million and the median was about $13 million.","doc_id":"[FR Doc. 2019-07300 Filed 4-15-19; 8:45 am]","end":473,"key":"treaty","order_code":79,"phrase":"South Pacific Tuna Treaty","start":448,"title":"International Fisheries; Pacific Tuna Fisheries; Procedures for the Active and Inactive Vessel Register","type":"prorule"},{"agency":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION","content":"These helicopters have been approved by EASA and are approved for operation in the United States.
